* AWS China is completely isolate intentionally from AWS Global to meet regulatory compliance for Mainland China.
* AWS China is on its own domain at: amazonaws.cn
* In order to operate in a AWS China Region you need have a Chinese Business License (ICP license)
* Not all services are available in china eg. Route53
* Running in Mainland China (instead of Singapore) means you would not need to traverse the The Great Firewall.
