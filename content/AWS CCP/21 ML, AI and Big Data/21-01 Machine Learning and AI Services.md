### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Machines that perform jobs that mimic human behavior

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machines that get better at a task without explicit programming

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?

Machines that have an artificial neural network inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems.

**Amazon SageMaker** is a fully managed service to **build, train, and deploy machine learning models** at scale

* **Apache MXNet on AWS**, open-source deep learning framework
* **TensorFlow on AWS** open-source machine intelligence library
* **PyTorch on AWS** open-source machine learning framework

## Amazon SageMaker GroundTruth
