## Encryption In-Transit

Data that is secure when moving between locations  
Algorithms: **TLS, SSL**

## Encryption At-Rest

Data that is secure when residing on storage or within a database  
Algorithms: **AES, RSA**

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

An encryption protocol for data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications.  
TLS 1.0, 1.1 are deprecated. **TLS 1.2** and **1.3** is the current best practice

## Secure Sockets Layers (SSL)

An encryption protocol for data integrity between two or more communicating computer application
