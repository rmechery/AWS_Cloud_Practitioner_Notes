### Change Management

Change management in the context of Cloud Infrastructure is when we have a formal process to:

* enforce changes
* Remediate changes

### Compliance-as-code (CaC)

Compliance as code is when we utilize programming to automate the monitoring, enforcing, and remediating changes to stay compliant with compliance programs or expected configuration.
