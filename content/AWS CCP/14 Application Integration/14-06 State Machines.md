* Coordinate multiple AWS Services into a serverless workflow
* A graphical console to visualize the components of your application as a series of steps.
* Automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected, every time
* logs the state of each step, so when things go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly
