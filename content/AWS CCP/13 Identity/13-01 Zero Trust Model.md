The Zero Trust model operates on the principle of “trust no one, verify everything.”

* Malicious actors being able to by-pass conventional access controls demonstrates traditional security measures are no longer sufficient
* In the Zero Trust Model ==Identity== becomes the primary security perimeter.

## What is the Primary Security Perimeter?

The primary or new security perimeter defines the first line of defense and its security controls that protect a company’s cloud resources and assets

### Network-Centric: (Old-Way)

traditional security-focused on firewalls and VPNs since there were few employees or workstations outside the office or they were in specific remote offices.

### Identity-Centric: (New-Way)

Bring-your-own-device, remote workstations are much more common, we can’t trust if the employee is in a secure location, we have identity-based security controls like MFA, or providing provisional access based on the level of risk from where, when, and what a user wants to access.
