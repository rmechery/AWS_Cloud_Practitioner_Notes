|VMs|Containers|
|---|----------|
|VMs **do not** make the best use of space.|Containers allow you to run multiple apps which are virtually isolated from each other.|
|Apps are not isolated which could cause **config conflicts, security problems, or resource hogging**.|Launch new containers and configure OS Dependencies per container.|
