![35](images/15_Containers/15-04/Docker_Logo.png) **Docker** is a set of [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](../01%20Cloud%20Concepts/01-07%20Types%20of%20Cloud%20Computing.md#platform-as-a-service-paas) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Docker was the earliest popularized open-source container platform.  
When people think of containers, they think of Docker.

**Docker CLI** – CLI commands to download, upload, build run and debug containers  
**Dockerfile** – a configuration file on how to provision a container  
**Docker Compose** – is a tool and configuration file when working with multiple containers  
**Docker Swarm** – An orchestration tool for managing deployed multi-containers architectures  
**Dockerhub** – a public online repository for containers published by the community for download

**The Open Container Initiative (OCI)** is an open governance structure for creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime. Docker established the OCI and it is now maintained by the Linux Foundation.
