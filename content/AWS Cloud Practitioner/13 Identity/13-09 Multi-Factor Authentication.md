**What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?**  
A security control where after you fill in your username/email and password **you have to use a second device** such as a phone to confirm that it's you logging in.

MFA **protects** against people who have stolen your password.

MFA is an option in most cloud providers and even social media websites such as Facebook.
