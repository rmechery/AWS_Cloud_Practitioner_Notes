 > A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords​

LDAP enables for **same-sign on**. The same sign-on allows the same userID and password to be used for multiple applications, but they have to enter it in every time they want to login.​

## **Why use LDAP when SSO is more convenient?​**

* Most SSO systems are using LDAP.​
* LDAP was not designed natively to work with web applications.​
* Some systems only support integration with LDAP and not SSO​
