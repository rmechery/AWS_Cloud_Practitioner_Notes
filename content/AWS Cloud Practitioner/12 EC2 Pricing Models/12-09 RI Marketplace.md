EC2 Reserved Instance Marketplace allows you to ==**sell your unused Standard RI**== to recoup your RI spend for RI you do not intend or cannot use.

* Reserved Instances can be sold after they have been active for at least 30 days and once AWS has received the upfront payment (if applicable).
* You must have a US bank account to sell Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
* There must be at least one month remaining in the term of the Reserved Instance you are listing.
* You will retain the pricing and capacity benefit of your reservation until it's sold and the transaction is complete.
* Your company name (and address upon request) will be shared with the buyer for tax purposes.
* A seller can set only the upfront price for a Reserved Instance. The usage price and other configuration (e.g., instance type, Availability Zone, platform) will remain the same as when the Reserved Instance was initially purchased.
* The term length will be rounded down to the nearest month. For example, a reservation with 9 months and 15 days remaining will appear as 9 months on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
* You can sell up to $20,000 in Reserved Instances per year. If you need to sell more Reserved Instances.
* Reserved Instances in the GovCloud region cannot be sold on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.
