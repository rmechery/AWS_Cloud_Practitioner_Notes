## What is cryptography?

The practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries

## What is encryption?

The process of encoding (scrabbling) information **using a key** and a **cypher** to store sensitive data in an unintelligible format as a means of protection. An encryption takes in plaintext and produces **ciphertext**.

The enigma machine was used during WW2. A different key for each day was used to set the position of the rotors. It relied on simple cypher substitution.

## Cyphers

### What is a cypher?

A cipher (also spelled "cypher") is a cryptographic technique that encrypts information to ensure its confidentiality and integrity. It scrambles data, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key or algorithm.

### What is ciphertext?

* Ciphertext is the encrypted form of a message or data resulting from applying encryption to plaintext.
* A **codebook** is a type of document used for gathering and storing cryptography codes

## Cryptographic Keys

### What is a cryptographic key?

A key is a variable used in conjunction with an encryption algorithm in order to encrypt or decrypt data.

### What is symmetric encryption?

The same key is used for encoding and decoding. eg **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

### What is asymmetric encryption?

Two keys are used. One to encode and one to decode eg. **Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)**
