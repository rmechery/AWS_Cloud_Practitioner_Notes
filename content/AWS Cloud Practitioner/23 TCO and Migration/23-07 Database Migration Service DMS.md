![35](images/icons/Database_Migration_Service.png) **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** allows you to quickly and securely migrate one database to another. DMS can be used to migrate your on-premise database to AWS.

**AWS Schema Conversion Tool** is used in many cases to automatically convert a source database schema to a target database schema.

 > \[!warning\] Warning  
 > Each migration path requires a bit of research since not all combinations of sources and targets are possible.
