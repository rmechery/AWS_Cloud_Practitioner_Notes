**Consolidated Billing** is a feature of AWS Organizations that allows you to pay for multiple AWS accounts with **one bill**.

For billing, AWS treats all the accounts in an organization as if they were one account.

You can designate one **master account** **that pays the charges** of all the other **member accounts**.

Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost!

Use **Cost Explorer** to visualize usage for consolidated billing

You can combine the usage across all accounts in the organization to share the volume pricing discounts
