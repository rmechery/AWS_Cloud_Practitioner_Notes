**AWS Budget Report**Â is used alongside AWS Budgets to create and send daily, weekly, or monthly reports to monitor the performance of your AWS Budget that will be emailed to specific emails.

AWS Budget Reports serve as a more convenient way of staying on top of reports since they are delivered to your email instead of logging into the AWS Management Console
