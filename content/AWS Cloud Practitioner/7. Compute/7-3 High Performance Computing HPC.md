## The Nitro System

**The Nitro System** A combination of ==dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor== enabling faster innovation and enhanced security. All new EC2 instance types use the Nitro System. 

* Nitro Cards - specialized cards for VPC, EBS and Instance torage and controller card
* Nitro Security Chips - Integrated into motherboard. Protects hardware resources.
* Nitro Hypervisor - lightweight hypervisor Memory and CPU allocation Bare Metal-like performance

## Bare Metal Instance

**Bare Metal Instance** You can launch EC2 instances that have no hypervisor so you can run workloads directly on the hardware for maximum performance and control. The **M5 and R5** EC2 instances run bare metal.

## High Performance Computing (HPC)

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a cluster of hundreds of thousands of servers with fast connections between each of them with the purpose of boosting computing capacity.
