A **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** is a company which provides Cloud services:

* which offer many products e.g. tens to hundreds of services
* that can be chained together to create cloud architectures
* that are accessible via a Single Unified API eg. [AWS API](../05%20Management%20and%20Development%20Tools/05-01%20AWS%20API.md)
* that utilize metered billing <span style="color:#ff0000"></span>based on usage e.g. per second, per hour
* that have rich monitoring built in e.g. [AWS CloudTrail](../20%20Logging/20-02%20AWS%20CloudTrail.md)
* that have an [Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](01-07%20Types%20of%20Cloud%20Computing.md#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas) offering 
* which offer automation via [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../05%20Management%20and%20Development%20Tools/05-04%20Infrastructure%20as%20Code%20IaC.md) 

If a company offers multiple cloud services under a single UI but do not meet most of or all of these requirements, it would be referred to as a **Cloud Platform**. 

* ex. Twilio, HashiCorp, Databricks
