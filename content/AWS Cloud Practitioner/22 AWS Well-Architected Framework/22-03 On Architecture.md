The AWS Well-Architected Framework is designed around a different kind of team structure.

Enterprises generally have centralized teams with specific roles whereas AWS has distributed teams with flexible roles.

Distributed teams can come with new risks, AWS mitigates these with Practices, Mechanisms, and Leadership Principles
