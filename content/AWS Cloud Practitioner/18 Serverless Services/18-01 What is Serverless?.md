**What is Serverless?**  
Serverless architecture generally describes fully managed cloud services.

The classification of a cloud service being serverless is not a Boolean answer (yes or no), but an answer on a scale where a cloud service has a degree of serverless.

A serverless service could have all or most of the following characteristics:

|- [hightly elastic](../04%20Cloud%20Architecture/04-04%20High%20Elasticity.md) and [scalable](../04%20Cloud%20Architecture/04-03%20High%20Scalability.md) <br>- [Highly available](../04%20Cloud%20Architecture/04-02%20High%20Availability.md) <br>- [Highly durable](../04%20Cloud%20Architecture/04-06%20High%20Durability.md) <br>- Secure by default|Abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and are billed based on the execution of your business task.|Serverless can **Scale-to-Zero** meaning when not in use the serverless resources cost nothing.|
