<a href=/AWS_Cloud_Practitioner_Notes/AWS-CCP/16-Governance/16-01-Organizations-and-Accounts/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/AWS_Cloud_Practitioner_Notes/AWS-CCP/16-Governance/16-01-Organizations-and-Accounts/>AWS Organizations</a> treats all the accounts in the organization as one account. This means that all accounts in the organization can receive the hourly cost benefit of Reserved Instances that are purchased by any other account. For example, Suppose that Fiona and John each have an account in an organization. Fiona has five Reserved Instances of the same type, and John has none. During one particular hour, Fiona uses three instances and John uses six, for a total of nine instances on the organization&rsquo;s consolidated bill. AWS bills five instances as Reserved Instances, and the remaining four instances as On-demand instances.</p></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-2><h2 id=question-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 2</h2></a><p>You have deployed your application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. Your customers complain that sometimes they can’t reach your application. Which AWS service allows you to monitor the performance of your EC2 instances to assist in troubleshooting these issues?</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> A. AWS CloudTrail</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> B. Amazon CloudWatch</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> C. AWS Config</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> D. AWS Lambda</li></ul><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed example-callout"><p>Answer</p><p>Correct Answer: B<br>Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any log files your applications generate. You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.<br><em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Amazon Cognito&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon Cognito allows you to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;AWS KMS&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS KMS provides a highly available key storage, management, and auditing solution for you to encrypt data within your own applications and control the encryption of stored data across AWS services.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;AWS Config&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS Config is a service that enables you to monitor, assess, and audit all changes made to your AWS resources.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-3><h2 id=question-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 3</h2></a><p>Hundreds of thousands of DDoS attacks are recorded every month worldwide. What service does AWS provide to help protect AWS Customers from these attacks? (Choose TWO)</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> A. AWS KMS</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> B. Amazon Cognito</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> C. AWS Shield</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> D. AWS Config</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> E. AWS WAF</li></ul><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed example-callout"><p>Answer</p><p>Correct Answer: C and E<br> Explanation: AWS provides flexible infrastructure and services that help customers implement strong DDoS mitigations and create highly available application architectures that follow AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency. These include services such as <strong>Amazon Route 53, Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, and AWS WAF</strong> to control and absorb traffic, and deflect unwanted requests. These services integrate with <strong>AWS Shield</strong>, a managed DDoS protection service that provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations to safeguard web applications running on AWS.<br> <em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Amazon Cognito&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon Cognito allows you to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;AWS KMS&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS KMS provides a highly available key storage, management, and auditing solution for you to encrypt data within your own applications and control the encryption of stored data across AWS services.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;AWS Config&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS Config is a service that enables you to monitor, assess, and audit all changes made to your AWS resources.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-4><h2 id=question-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 4</h2></a><p>What does Amazon CloudFront use to distribute content to global users with low latency?</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> A. AWS Edge Locations</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> B. AWS Availability Zones</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> C. AWS Global Accelerator</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> D. AWS Regions</li></ul><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed example-callout"><p>Answer</p><p>Correct Answer: A<br>Explanation: To deliver content to global end users with lower latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches in multiple cities around the world. Amazon CloudFront uses this network to cache copies of your content close to your end-users. Amazon CloudFront ensures that end-user requests are served by the closest edge location. As a result, end-user requests travel a short distance, improving performance for your end-users, while reducing the load on the origin servers.<br><em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>AWS Global Accelerator is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS Global Accelerator and CloudFront are two separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable (e.g., images and videos) and dynamic content (e.g. dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator is a good fit for specific use cases, such as gaming, IoT or Voice over IP.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;AWS Availability Zones&rdquo; and &ldquo;AWS Regions&rdquo; are incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon CloudFront only uses Edge Locations or Regional Edge Caches.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-5><h2 id=question-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 5</h2></a><p>Which service provides object-level storage in AWS?</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> A. Amazon EBS</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> B. Amazon EFS</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> C. Amazon Instance Store</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> D. Amazon S3</li></ul><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed example-callout"><p>Answer</p><p>Correct Answer: D<br>Explanation: Amazon S3 is an object level storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere – web sites and mobile apps, corporate applications, and data from IoT sensors or devices. It is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and stores data for millions of applications used by market leaders in every industry.<br><em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Amazon EFS&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon EFS is a <strong>file-level</strong> storage technology that provides massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances, enabling your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS with consistently low latencies.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Amazon EBS&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon EBS is a <strong>block-level</strong> storage that provides storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS instances.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Amazon Instance Store&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> An instance store provides temporary <strong>block-level</strong> storage for your EC2 instances. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-6><h2 id=question-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 6</h2></a><p>A startup company is operating on limited funds and is extremely concerned about cost overruns. Which of the below options can be used to notify the company when their monthly AWS bill exceeds $2000? (Choose TWO)</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Setup a CloudWatch billing alarm that triggers an SNS notification when the threshold is exceeded</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Configure the Amazon Simple Email Service to send billing alerts to their email address on a daily basis</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Configure the Amazon Connect Service to alert the company when the threshold is exceeded</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Configure AWS CloudTrail to automatically delete all AWS resources when the threshold is exceeded</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Configure the AWS Budgets Service to alert the company when the threshold is exceeded</li></ul><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed example-callout"><p>Answer</p><p>Correct Answer: A and E<br>Explanation: In CloudWatch, you can set up a billing alarm that triggers if your costs exceed a threshold that you set. This CloudWatch alarm can also be configured to trigger an SNS notification to your email address.<br>AWS Budgets is another AWS service that can be used in this scenario. AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. The difference between AWS Budgets and Amazon CloudWatch billing alarms is that Amazon CloudWatch billing alarms alert you only when your <strong>actual</strong> cost exceeds a certain threshold, while AWS Budgets can be configured to alert you when the <strong>actual</strong> or <strong>forecasted</strong> cost exceeds a certain threshold.<br><em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Configure the Amazon Connect Service to alert the company when the threshold is exceeded&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon Connect is a self-service, cloud-based contact center service that makes it easy for any business to deliver better customer service at lower cost. Amazon Connect cannot be used to send billing notifications.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Configure the Amazon Simple Email Service to send billing alerts to their email address on a daily basis&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. Amazon SES cannot be used to send billing alerts.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-7><h2 id=question-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 7</h2></a><p>A company has moved to AWS recently.

Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity. These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of a detailed assessment report which is available via the Amazon Inspector console or API. To help get started quickly, Amazon Inspector includes a knowledge base of hundreds of rules mapped to common security best practices and vulnerability definitions. Examples of built-in rules include checking for remote root login being enabled, or vulnerable software versions installed. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers.<br> <br> AWS Trusted Advisor offers a rich set of best practice checks and recommendations across five categories: <strong>cost optimization; security; fault tolerance; performance; and service limits.</strong> Like your customized cloud security expert, AWS Trusted Advisor analyzes your AWS environment and provides security recommendations to protect your AWS environment. The service improves the security of your applications by closing gaps, examining permissions, and enabling various AWS security features.<br> <br> <em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Amazon SNS&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> Amazon SNS is a pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Concierge Support Team&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> The AWS Concierge Support Team is a specialized offering available only to customers having an Enterprise or Enterprise On-Ramp Support subscription.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can determine the health status of an instance by using one or more of the following health checks:<ol><li>Amazon EC2 status checks and scheduled events: Checks that the instance is running; checks for underlying hardware or software issues that might impair the instance.</li><li>Elastic Load Balancing health checks: Checks whether the load balancer reports the instance as healthy, confirming whether the instance is available to handle requests.</li><li>Custom health checks: Checks for any other problems that might indicate instance health issues, according to your custom health checks.</li></ol><ul><li>The health status of an Auto Scaling instance indicates whether it is healthy or unhealthy. All instances in your Auto Scaling group start in the healthy state. Instances are assumed to be healthy unless Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling receives notification that they are unhealthy. This notification can come from sources such as Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, or custom health checks. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects an unhealthy instance, it terminates it and launches a new one.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-9><h2 id=question-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 9</h2></a><p>An organization has decided to purchase an Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) for three years in order to reduce costs.

Which of the following would help adhere to this principle? (Choose TWO)</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Elastic Load Balancing</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Multi-factor authentication</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Penetration testing</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Availability Zones</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Vertical Scaling</li></ul><blockquote class="callout-collapsible callout-collapsed example-callout"><p>Answer</p><p>Correct Answer: A and D<br>        Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. When designing your AWS Cloud architecture, you should make sure that your system will continue to run even if failures happen. You can achieve this by deploying your AWS resources in multiple Availability zones. Availability zones are isolated from each other; therefore, if one availability zone goes down, the other Availability Zones will still be up and running, and hence your application will be more fault-tolerant. In addition to availability zones, you can build a disaster recovery solution by deploying your AWS resources in other regions. If an entire region goes down, you will still have resources in another region able to continue to provide a solution. Finally, you can use the Elastic Load Balancing service to regularly perform health checks and distribute traffic only to healthy instances.<br><em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Multi-factor authentication&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password.

Penetration testing is much more related to security, not fault tolerance.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Vertical Scaling&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> A &ldquo;vertically scalable&rdquo; system is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory, or storage. Vertical scaling may improve performance, but not fault-tolerance; because if this &ldquo;one computer&rdquo; fails, the whole system will fail.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><a href=#question-12><h2 id=question-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Question 12</h2></a><p>​A company is introducing a <span style=color:#98f792>new</span> product to their customers, and is expecting a surge in traffic to their web application.

However, such patches are applied automatically when using Amazon RDS.<br><em><strong>The other options are incorrect:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Security of the IaaS services is the responsibility of AWS&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS products that fall into the well-understood category of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - such as Amazon EC2, and Amazon VPC -  are completely under your control and require you to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. For example, for EC2 instances, you’re responsible for management of the guest OS (including updates and security patches), any application software or utilities you install on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance. These are basically the same security tasks that you’re used to performing no matter where your servers are located.</li><li><em><strong>&ldquo;Security of the managed services is the responsibility of the customer&rdquo; is incorrect.</strong></em> AWS is responsible for the security configuration of its managed services. Examples of these types of services include Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce.
